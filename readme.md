This is a tidied version of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set made available by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at the University of California Irvine.

The raw data has been manipulated by run_analysis.R to perform the following operations:

Test and training data was combined; all measurements other than mean and standard deviation were ignored; activity measurements for each subject were aggregated and averaged.

Details of these operations are provided by comments in the script.
